House Price Prediction — PyTorch (Jupyter)

Optional Flask API for deployment

Overview

This project trains a PyTorch neural network to predict house prices from tabular features. It runs entirely in Jupyter Notebook and includes preprocessing, training/evaluation, visualizations, feature importance, and model saving. A minimal Flask API is provided as an optional deployment step.

Key Features

Data pipeline: scaling with StandardScaler, train/test split

Model: 2 hidden layers (ReLU, Dropout), Adam optimizer

Metrics & plots: MAE, RMSE, R², loss curves, actual vs. predicted scatter

Interpretability: feature importance from first-layer weights

Reusability: saves house_price_model.pth, scaler_X.pkl, scaler_y.pkl

Deployment (optional): house_price_api.py with /predict endpoint

Tech Stack

PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Joblib
(Optional) Flask for serving predictions

Notebook Flow

Data acquisition

Tries sklearn.datasets.load_boston(); if unavailable, falls back to a synthetic dataset with similar schema.

Preprocessing

Feature/target scaling (StandardScaler), train/test split

Model training

MLP (ReLU + Dropout), Adam, MSE loss; tracks train/test loss

Evaluation

Reports MAE/RMSE/R²; plots predictions vs actuals

Artifacts & inference

Saves model/scalers; predict_house_price(features) helper

(Optional) Flask API

Loads saved artifacts and exposes /predict (JSON)

Getting Started
# 1) Create env (optional)
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 2) Install deps
pip install -r requirements.txt


requirements.txt

torch
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
joblib
flask  # optional (only if you use the API)

Run (Jupyter workflow)

Open the notebook and run all cells.

After training, artifacts are saved:

house_price_model.pth

scaler_X.pkl, scaler_y.pkl

Use predict_house_price([...]) with a 13-feature list to get a price prediction.

Optional: Run the Flask API
python house_price_api.py
# POST JSON: {"features": [13 feature values in the same order as training]}
# Example:
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"features\": [0.02731,0.0,7.07,0,0.469,6.421,78.9,4.9671,2,242,17.8,396.90,9.14]}"

Notes

If load_boston() is unavailable (deprecated in some versions), the notebook automatically switches to a synthetic dataset with similar feature names.

Replace metrics in your README with your actual results after training.
